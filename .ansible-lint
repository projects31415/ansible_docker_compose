# Disable yamllint for specific line: add above or at the end of the line # yamllint disable-line rule:<rule-name>
# Ex.: # yamllint disable-line rule:line-length

# Disable rule for specific line/task: add at the end of line the line # noqa <rule-name>
# Ex.: # noqa name[casing], # noqa yaml[line-length], # noqa command-instead-of-shell
# or
# noqa yaml[line-length] disabled due to â€¦

# If you add # noqa [rule_id] to the end of the line then the rule will be skipped
# If the rule is task-based (most are), the # noqa [rule_id] can be at the end of any line in the task
# If the rule is line-based, # noqa [rule_id] must be at the end of the particular line to be skipped
# You can skip multiple rules via a space-separated list # noqa 201 402

# Ansible-lint profiles allow content creators to progressively improve the quality of Ansible playbooks, roles, and collections.
# During early development cycles, you need Ansible-lint rules to be less strict.

# Some rules can transform files to fix (or make it easier to fix) identified
# errors. `ansible-lint --write` will reformat YAML files and run these transforms.

# You can disable running transforms by setting `write_list: ["none"]`.
# Or only enable a subset of rule transforms by listing rules/tags here.
